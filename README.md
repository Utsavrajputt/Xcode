## 💡 Why Xcode?

Closed-source editors cover this niche already. Xcode is an open, from-scratch take on the part that
matters on a phone: **editing code and managing it with Git**. Building and running is deliberately
left to GitHub Actions or a PC — that is a different (and much heavier) problem.

## ✨ Features

<details>
<summary><b>📂 Projects & files</b></summary>

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|

| **File operations** | Create, rename, delete, move, copy and numbered duplicate, all from a long-press menu |
| **Git status stripe** | Coloured marker per file/folder — modified, added, untracked, conflicted |
| **Open Project sheet** | Search, type a path by hand, or browse folders with editable shortcuts |
| **Recent projects** | Home and *All projects* lists with search and sort. Per-project menu: **pin to top**, **rename**, **delete** (with confirmation), **project info** (size, files, last modified/opened, Git branch), copy path, remove from recents |

**Pattern:** MVVM + unidirectional data flow (`UiState` / events / effects). All file-system and JGit
work runs on `Dispatchers.IO`, never the main thread.

## 🧩 APK variants

Xcode ships one app, split per CPU architecture so you only download the native libraries your phone
can actually use:

| APK | For |
|---|---|
| `xcode-<tag>-arm64-v8a.apk` | Almost every phone from the last decade — **pick this one** |
| `xcode-<tag>-armeabi-v7a.apk` | Older 32-bit ARM devices |
| `xcode-<tag>-universal.apk` | Both ARM ABIs in one file — larger, use it if you're unsure |

x86 / x86_64 builds are intentionally not produced.

---

## 🔨 Building

Requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (compileSdk 36, minSdk 30).

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug      # debug APK (installs next to release as com.invictus.xcode.debug)
./gradlew assembleRelease    # unsigned release APKs, one per ABI + universal (sign with apksigner)
./gradlew lintDebug          # Android lint
```

Or open the project in Android Studio and run it normally.

### Signing a release build

Release builds are intentionally unsigned by Gradle — `assembleRelease` produces unsigned APKs which
you sign explicitly with `apksigner`:

```bash
apksigner sign --ks your-release.jks --ks-key-alias <alias> \
  --out xcode-arm64-v8a.apk app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release-unsigned.apk
```

CI does this for you through [`.github/scripts/sign-apks.sh`](.github/scripts/sign-apks.sh). Every push
to `main` runs `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` and uploads the signed APKs as build artifacts
(fork PRs have no secrets, so their APKs stay unsigned). It needs these repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded signing keystore |
| `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `KEY_ALIAS` | Key alias |
| `KEY_PASSWORD` | Key password |

---

## 🚀 Releases

Two tag-triggered workflows build signed APKs and publish them to GitHub Releases, with SHA-256
checksums and notes pulled from `CHANGELOG.md`:

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — stable releases, tags matching `vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `v1.0.0`, the current release).
- **`.github/workflows/prerelease.yml`** — pre-releases, tags matching `vX.Y.Z-suffix` (e.g.
  `v1.0.0-beta.1`, `v1.0.0-rc.2`). The GitHub Release is flagged **Pre-release** automatically.

Both fail if any signing secret is missing — a release is never published unsigned.

To cut a release:

1. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` (pre-releases may keep
   `[x.y.z]` or stay under `[Unreleased]`), then commit and push to `main`.
2. Tag the commit and push the tag:

   ```bash
   # stable
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0

   # pre-release
   git tag v1.0.0-beta.1
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta.1
   ```

3. The matching job publishes the GitHub Release with all three APKs attached.

There is nothing to bump in Gradle: the tag sets `versionName` (`v1.2.3` → `1.2.3`) and
[`.github/scripts/version-from-tag.sh`](.github/scripts/version-from-tag.sh) derives a `versionCode`
that always increases (`alpha` < `beta` < `rc` < stable of the same version), so a beta updates
cleanly into its final release.

You can also run either workflow by hand from **Actions → Make release / Make pre-release →
Run workflow** and typing the tag name, without pushing a tag first.

## 🔐 Permissions

- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` — "All files access", so Xcode can work directly on your project folders
- `INTERNET` — Git clone/push/pull over HTTPS and GitHub profile lookups
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` — clone and sync progress

---

## 🚫 Out of scope

On-device build/run, SDK/Gradle/JDK management, a terminal, SSH auth, LSP servers, AI agents/MCP,
a plugin system and a real Compose/XML/Flutter layout preview.
